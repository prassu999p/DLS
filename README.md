Deep-learning sessions

Assignment -1 
A dataset that says weather a guy will get admission or not for his graduation in a college.
This is a kaggle dataset -
What will you do ? 
1.Tell me the order of all the matrixes that you get
2.Cost , accuracy of train & test
3.Split is a 70-30 split , random set to be - 20
4.Show me the value of learning rate that you have taken

Assignment -2
1.Complete the code in session 5
2.Implement the code for the data set of assignment 2, random states-20 , iteration =10000 , learning rate =1.2
3.Change the parameteres , or change whatever is changable and produce a good accuracy for test. Compare with train and comment about bias and variance

Assignment -3 
Work on the data set in session 7 , work towards bias/variance. Understand regularization and initialization method. Give your commentary on which is bias/variance case and which is not.

Assignment -4 
Image classification using CNN

Assignment-5 [14-06-2020]
Stock price prediction using LSTM

Assignment-6[21-06-2020]
Use SOM code to work out the diabetes dataset as an unsupervised learning

Assignment-7[28-06-2020]

session -1 
Understanding logistic regression and implementation in python
This session also contains the conversion of linear regression to logistic regression

Session -2 
Implementing an activation function over the various fields of previous example
(A shallow neural network using tensor flow and keras) 

Session -3 
Mathematical representation of what is going on in the neural network mathematically . 
How do we understand this mathematics in laymans term.
After converting this into laymans term, we also implement these mathematical logic into our python notebook over same example.

session -4
Taking this concept one step ahead, understanding NN with one hidden layer

session -5
Uploaded a notebook 
Session speaks about single layered neural network
